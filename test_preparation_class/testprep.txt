1. A math competition was held in Brook Hill Secondary. All the students were solving
the same problem set. Teachers checked their work but they weren't careful so all of their points are mixed up and they
need your help to print a sorted list. Help them! List should be descending!

2. For statistics' sake we need to find average number of points on this competition. Print that as well!

3. We want to check if a certain number of points was acquired by a certain student. Check that - but be careful - linear complexity is reeeeallllyyy bad
because Brook Hill has a lot of students.

S(0) = 0 array[0] = 0;
S(1) = 0 array[1] = 1;

for every next member: a[i] = sum_of_digits(a[i-1]) + sum_of_digits(a[i-2])

Given a number n find a[n]
