Brook Hill A level programming

On the programming part of the test you will only have linear and binary search, bubble
and insetion sort. Don't focus on stacks, queues and graphs - that will come later. However
on the theoretical part you should be prepared for everything before graphs.

In the file Practice Problems you can find some practice problems. Feel free to discuss solutions amongst yourselves, if there's any trouble
with those problems e-mail me.

Good luck! :)
